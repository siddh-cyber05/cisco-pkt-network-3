# network-3: Router Configuration and Static Routing

This repository contains the implementation and configuration details for static routing using router commands as part of **Computer Networks Assignment 4**.

## Objective
The primary goal of this assignment is to:
- Configure routers using appropriate commands.
- Implement static routing for a given topology.
- Verify successful connections between all sections of the network.

## Network Topology
The network consists of five sections, each with distinct IP addressing:

### IP Addressing Scheme
- **Section 1**: IPs ranging from `200.1.0.2` in the `1.0.0` network, with the default gateway set to `1.0.1`.
- **Section 2**: IPs ranging from `200.2.0.2` in the `2.0.0` network, with the default gateway set to `2.0.1`.
- **Section 3**: IPs ranging from `200.3.0.2` in the `3.0.0` network, with the default gateway set to `3.0.1`.
- **Section 4**: IPs ranging from `200.4.0.2` in the `4.0.0` network, with the default gateway set to `4.0.1`.
- **Section 5**: IPs ranging from `200.5.0.2` in the `5.0.0` network, with the default gateway set to `5.0.1`.

## Router Configuration
Each router is configured to handle static routing based on the above topology. The key routers include:
1. **Router 0**:
   - [Details about static routes and connections for Router 0]
2. **Router 1**:
   - [Details about static routes and connections for Router 1]
3. Additional routers follow similar configurations as required.

## Output
The output verifies successful static routing with seamless connections between all network sections.

## Files in Repository
- **Assignment Report**: A detailed explanation of the router configurations and the IP addressing scheme.
- **Screenshots**: Visual proof of successful routing.
- **Configuration Files**: Command scripts for router configuration.

## How to Run
1. Set up the topology using a simulator like Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3.
2. Apply the configuration commands provided in the repository.
3. Test connectivity using ping commands to ensure the setup works as expected.
